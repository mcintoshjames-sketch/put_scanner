# Best-Practice Fit Review - Summary

## Completed: Phase 1 (Critical Improvements)

### Implementation Date: October 30, 2025
### Commit: 5649c29

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Volume/OI Ratio Check** (All Strategies)
**Purpose:** Validates that options have healthy trading volume relative to open interest.

**Thresholds:**
- ‚úÖ Green: Ratio ‚â• 0.5 (healthy daily turnover)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Ratio 0.25-0.5 (moderate turnover)
- ‚ùå Red: Ratio < 0.25 (stale open interest risk)

**Why It Matters:** High OI with low volume may indicate stale positions that won't be easy to exit.

**Example:**
- OI = 1,000 contracts
- Volume = 600 ‚Üí Ratio = 0.6 ‚úÖ (Good)
- Volume = 100 ‚Üí Ratio = 0.1 ‚ùå (Risky)

---

### 2. **Earnings Proximity Check** (CSP, CC)
**Purpose:** Warns traders when earnings announcements fall within the option cycle.

**Behavior:**
- Checks `DaysToEarnings` field from row data
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning if earnings during cycle (0 ‚â§ days ‚â§ DTE)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning if earnings shortly after expiry (DTE < days ‚â§ DTE + 7)
- ‚úÖ Green if no earnings soon (days > DTE + 7)
- Sets `earnings_risk` flag for runbook warnings

**Why It Matters:** Earnings create gap risk and elevated volatility - traders need explicit warnings.

**Example:**
- DTE = 30 days
- Earnings in 15 days ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning + Flag
- Earnings in 35 days ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning (shortly after)
- Earnings in 60 days ‚Üí ‚úÖ Clear

---

### 3. **Wing Distance Check** (Iron Condor)
**Purpose:** Evaluates how far the long strikes (wings) are from the short strikes.

**Calculation:**
- Wing distance % = (Long strike - Short strike) / Short strike √ó 100
- Evaluated for both put and call sides

**Thresholds:**
- ‚úÖ Green: Min wing distance ‚â• 2% (adequate safety buffer)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Min wing distance 1-2% (tight wings)
- ‚ùå Red: Min wing distance < 1% (very tight, high risk)

**Why It Matters:** Tighter wings = higher max profit but less safety margin. Should be explicit trade-off.

**Example:**
- Short put @ $550, Long put @ $530 ‚Üí ($530-$550)/$550 = -3.6% ‚úÖ
- Short put @ $550, Long put @ $540 ‚Üí ($540-$550)/$550 = -1.8% ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Short put @ $550, Long put @ $548 ‚Üí ($548-$550)/$550 = -0.36% ‚ùå

### 4. **Cost Basis Check** (Covered Call)
**Purpose:** Prevents selling calls below cost basis, which locks in losses if assigned.

**Behavior:**
- Requires `CostBasis` field in row data (optional, user-provided)
- ‚úÖ Green if strike ‚â• cost basis (profit or breakeven if assigned)
- ‚ùå Red if strike < cost basis (forced loss if assigned)
- Sets `below_cost_basis` flag for runbook warnings

**Why It Matters:** Assignment at a strike below cost basis crystallizes a loss. Critical mistake to avoid.

**Example:**
- Cost basis: $170
- Strike $175 ‚Üí ‚úÖ +2.9% if assigned
- Strike $165 ‚Üí ‚ùå -2.9% loss if assigned

---

### 5. **Enhanced Runbook Warnings**
**New Warning Messages:**

```
"Earnings announcement within cycle ‚Äî expect elevated volatility and gap risk."
```
Triggered by: `earnings_risk` flag

```
"CC strike is below cost basis ‚Äî assignment would lock in a loss. Consider higher strike or waiting."
```
Triggered by: `below_cost_basis` flag

**Also Updated:**
- Tenor warning now mentions Iron Condor: "30-60 DTE (Collar/IC)"

---

## üìä Test Results

### test_fit_improvements.py: **17/17 tests pass** ‚úÖ

**Test Coverage:**
1. Volume/OI Ratio: 4/4 tests (high/moderate/low turnover, missing data)
2. Earnings Proximity: 4/4 tests (during cycle, after expiry, no earnings, missing data)
3. Wing Distance: 3/3 tests (wide/moderate/tight wings)
4. Cost Basis: 4/4 tests (above/below/at basis, missing data)
5. Flag Validation: 2/2 tests (earnings_risk, below_cost_basis)

---

## üìà Impact Assessment

### Risk Management Improvements:
- **Earnings Risk**: Explicit warnings prevent unexpected volatility exposure
- **Position Sizing**: Volume/OI ratio catches illiquid traps before entry
- **Loss Prevention**: Cost basis check prevents forced losses on CC assignments
- **Iron Condor Safety**: Wing distance quantifies risk/reward trade-off

### User Experience:
- **More Actionable**: Each check has clear thresholds and recommendations
- **Data-Driven**: Objective metrics replace guesswork
- **Comprehensive**: Covers both entry criteria and ongoing risk

---

## üéØ Still Pending (Phase 2 & 3)

### Phase 2 (Important - Future Enhancement)
1. **Probability of Profit** - Win rate context (CSP, CC, IC)
2. **IV Rank** - Market timing for premium strategies
3. **Short Strike Delta Check** - Standardized Iron Condor deltas
4. **Skew Analysis** - Put/call IV asymmetry for Iron Condors

### Phase 3 (Nice to Have)
1. **Market Regime Indicator** - VIX-based context
2. **Support/Resistance Proximity** - Technical analysis integration
3. **Historical Performance** - Similar setup backtesting
4. **Portfolio Correlation** - Multi-position risk

**Estimated Effort:**
- Phase 2: 3-4 hours
- Phase 3: 2-3 hours
- Data integration: 4-6 hours

---

## üìù Data Requirements

### Currently Available:
- ‚úÖ OI, Spread%, Volume (option chain)
- ‚úÖ DaysToEarnings (needs integration from earnings calendar API)
- ‚úÖ Strike prices for all legs
- ‚úÖ CostBasis (user input via settings)

### Missing (for Phase 2/3):
- IVRank (52-week IV percentile)
- Individual leg deltas (PutShortDelta, CallShortDelta)
- Individual leg IVs (PutIV, CallIV)
- VIX level (for market regime)
- Account size (for position sizing %)

---

## üîÑ Integration Points

### Where It's Used:
1. **Plan & Runbook Tab** - Main best-practice evaluation
2. **Runbook Warnings** - Flags trigger warning messages
3. **evaluate_fit() Function** - Core validation logic

### Backward Compatible:
- All new checks gracefully handle missing data (show "n/a" or skip)
- Existing strategies (CSP, CC, COLLAR) still work
- New Iron Condor checks only activate for IC strategy

---

## üìö Documentation

### Files Created:
1. **BEST_PRACTICE_FIT_REVIEW.md** - Complete analysis and roadmap
2. **test_fit_improvements.py** - Validation test suite
3. **This summary** - Implementation overview

### Code Changes:
- **strategy_lab.py** `evaluate_fit()` - 5 new checks added
- **strategy_lab.py** Plan & Runbook - 2 new warning messages
- **strategy_lab.py** flags dict - 2 new flags added
