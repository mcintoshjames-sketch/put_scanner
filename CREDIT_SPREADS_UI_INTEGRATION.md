# Credit Spreads UI Integration - Completion Report

## Summary
Fixed two remaining UI integration gaps for Bull Put Spread and Bear Call Spread strategies. Both the Best-Practice Fit analysis and Trade Runbook generation now fully support credit spreads.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Best-Practice Fit Missing Data ✅
**Problem**: Volume/OI ratio showed "n/a (volume data missing)" for credit spreads  
**Root Cause**: `evaluate_fit()` function had no BULL_PUT_SPREAD or BEAR_CALL_SPREAD cases

**Solution**: Added comprehensive best-practice checks for both strategies:

#### BULL_PUT_SPREAD Checks:
- **Spread Width**: Validates 2-10% of underlying price (not too narrow/wide)
- **Risk/Reward Ratio**: Checks min 0.4 (profit/risk ratio)
- **Delta Target**: Validates short put delta ~0.15-0.30 (80%+ POEW)
- **Tenor**: 30-60 DTE sweet spot
- **Liquidity**: OI, spread%, volume/OI ratio
- **Excess vs T-bills**: Annualized premium vs risk-free rate

#### BEAR_CALL_SPREAD Checks:
- Same structure as Bull Put Spread
- **Spread Width**: Buy strike - Sell strike (2-10% validation)
- **Delta Target**: Short call delta ~0.15-0.30
- All other checks identical

**Example Output**:
```
Check                 Status  Notes
Tenor sweet spot      ✅      35 DTE within 30-60
Liquidity             ✅      OI 1,500 ok, spread 2.5% ok
Volume/OI ratio       ✅      0.82 (healthy turnover)
Spread width          ✅      $5.00 (3.5% of price)
Risk/reward ratio     ✅      0.42 (profit $2.10 / risk $2.90)
Δ target (short put)  ✅      -0.22 (good POEW ~78%)
Excess vs T-bills     ✅      +18.5% annualized
```

### 2. Empty Trade Runbook ✅
**Problem**: Runbook tab showed no text for credit spreads  
**Root Cause**: `build_runbook()` function had no credit spread cases

**Solution**: Generated comprehensive trade execution runbooks:

#### BULL_PUT_SPREAD Runbook Includes:
```
# RUNBOOK — BULL PUT SPREAD (NVDA)
------------------------------------------------------------
ENTRY (2-leg vertical spread):
• Sell to Open  1  NVDA  2024-12-20  270 PUT   (short put - collect premium)
• Buy to Open   1  NVDA  2024-12-20  265 PUT   (long put - define max loss)
  Order: NET CREDIT, ≥ $2.10 per share (≥ $210 per contract), GTC
  Capital required: $290 (max risk per spread)
  Max profit: $210 (if NVDA stays above $270)
  Max loss: $290 (if NVDA drops below $265)
  Breakeven: $267.90

PROFIT‑TAKING TRIGGER(S):
• Close when spread mark ≤ $0.63 per share  (≈ 70% credit captured), OR
• Close/roll at ~7–10 DTE if ≥50% credit captured, OR
• Close at ~21 DTE if ≥75% credit captured.

RISK CLOSE‑OUT TRIGGER(S):
• Underlying drops to within $2 of short strike: ≤ $272
• Underlying breaches breakeven: ≤ $267.90
• Total P&L reaches 2× max profit (close to avoid max loss)
• Consider rolling down/out: close current spread, open new one with lower strikes or later expiry

EXIT ORDERS (close both legs):
• Profit‑take:  Close entire spread for NET DEBIT ≤ $0.63 per share, GTC
  - BTC  1  NVDA  2024-12-20  270 PUT
  - STC  1  NVDA  2024-12-20  265 PUT
• Risk close‑out: Close at market or use STOP‑LIMIT for full spread.

ROLLING (if under pressure):
• Roll down/out: Close current 270/265 spread, open new spread further OTM or later expiry
• Target: collect additional credit while reducing breach risk
• Keep spread width consistent (same risk profile)
```

#### BEAR_CALL_SPREAD Runbook:
- Same structure but for call spreads
- Breakeven = Sell strike + net credit
- Risk triggers: price rises toward/above short call
- Rolling instructions: up/out (higher strikes or later expiry)

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
- `strategy_lab.py` - Lines 2747-2834 (evaluate_fit additions)
- `strategy_lab.py` - Lines 2999-3098 (build_runbook additions)

### Code Structure
Both functions follow the existing pattern:
1. Extract strike prices and premium from row
2. Calculate derived metrics (breakeven, risk/reward, etc.)
3. Apply strategy-specific logic
4. Return formatted output (DataFrame for checks, string for runbook)

### Key Functions Used
- `_series_get()` - Safe row value extraction
- `_fmt_usd()` - Currency formatting for runbook
- Standard deviation/cushion calculations reused from existing strategies

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Required:
- [ ] Run scan with Bull Put Spread enabled
- [ ] Select a Bull Put contract in UI
- [ ] Navigate to "Plan & Runbook" tab
- [ ] Verify "Best-Practice Fit" shows all checks (not "volume data missing")
- [ ] Verify "Trade Runbook" displays complete text (not empty)
- [ ] Repeat for Bear Call Spread

### Expected Behavior:
1. **Best-Practice Fit**: Table with 6-8 rows showing spread width, risk/reward, delta, liquidity, etc.
2. **Trade Runbook**: Multi-section text with ENTRY, PROFIT-TAKING, RISK CLOSE-OUT, EXIT ORDERS, ROLLING

## Commits

### commit f9267eb (HEAD -> main, origin/main)
**Message**: Add credit spread support to Best-Practice Fit and Trade Runbook

**Changes**:
- `evaluate_fit()`: Added BULL_PUT_SPREAD and BEAR_CALL_SPREAD checks
  * Spread width validation (2-10% of price)
  * Risk/reward ratio checks (min 0.4)
  * Delta target validation (0.15-0.30 for 80%+ POEW)
  
- `build_runbook()`: Added comprehensive runbook generation
  * BULL_PUT_SPREAD: 2-leg entry/exit, profit targets, risk triggers, rolling instructions
  * BEAR_CALL_SPREAD: 2-leg entry/exit, profit targets, risk triggers, rolling instructions
  * Both include breakeven calculations, capital requirements, and detailed order syntax

**Stats**: 1 file changed, 182 insertions(+)

## Completion Status

### Previously Fixed (Earlier Commits):
- ✅ bb2ce10: Runbook tab KeyError (added credit spreads to base dictionary)
- ✅ 268b88e: Stress Test ValueError (added shock analysis for credit spreads)

### Just Completed:
- ✅ f9267eb: Best-Practice Fit missing data
- ✅ f9267eb: Empty Trade Runbook

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Manual Verification):
1. Test the UI to confirm both issues are resolved
2. Verify runbook formatting looks clean (no line breaks or escape characters)
3. Check that all calculated values make sense (breakeven, max loss, etc.)

### Future Enhancements (Optional):
- Add credit spread-specific risk metrics (e.g., probability of touch)
- Include historical win rate data if available
- Add visual diagrams for P&L curves
- Implement multi-contract examples in runbook

## Notes

### Design Decisions:
1. **Risk/Reward Threshold**: Set to 0.4 for credit spreads vs 0.5 for iron condors (reflects typical market conditions)
2. **Delta Range**: 0.15-0.30 targets ~70-85% POEW (more conservative than some traders)
3. **Profit Capture**: Default 70% (industry standard for mechanical exits)

### Known Limitations:
- Volume/OI checks use option volume from short leg only (may not reflect full spread liquidity)
- Runbook assumes GTC orders (not all brokers support this for multi-leg)
- Rolling instructions are general guidance (not broker-specific syntax)
