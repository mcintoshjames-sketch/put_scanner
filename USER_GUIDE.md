## Overview

### What is Strategy Lab?

Strategy Lab is a comprehensive options analysis tool designed for **risk-managed, short-term income generation** using three core strategies:

1. **Cash-Secured Puts (CSP)** - Generate income while waiting to buy stocks at a discount
2. **Covered Calls (CC)** - Generate income on stocks you already own
3. **Collars** - Protect downside while capping upside

### Who Is This For?

- **Conservative income traders** seeking 10-45 day positions
- **Theta harvesting enthusiasts** looking for the time-decay sweet spot (21-35 DTE)
- **Risk-aware investors** who want quantified probabilities and Greeks
- **Systematic traders** who prefer data-driven decision making

### Core Philosophy

This tool is built around **three pillars**:

1. **Risk Management First** - Never sacrifice safety for yield
2. **Time Decay Optimization** - Target the 21-35 DTE "sweet spot" where theta is highest relative to gamma
3. **Liquidity Matters** - Only trade options with sufficient open interest and tight bid-ask spreads

## Financial Strategy Explained

### The Core Strategies

#### 1. Cash-Secured Put (CSP)

**What It Is:**
- You **sell (write) a put option** on a stock you'd be willing to own
- You collect **premium upfront**
- You must have **cash reserved** to buy 100 shares if assigned

**When to Use:**
- You're bullish or neutral on a stock
- You want to own the stock at a lower price (the strike)
- You want to generate income while waiting

**Example:**
```
Stock: AAPL trading at $180
Action: Sell 1 AAPL Nov 15 $170 PUT
Premium: $2.50 ($250)
Days: 21 DTE

Outcomes:
- Stock stays above $170 → Keep $250 premium (13.2% annualized return)
- Stock drops below $170 → Buy 100 shares at $170, effective cost $167.50
```

**Risk:**
- Maximum loss = Strike price - premium (if stock goes to $0)
- You're obligated to buy the stock if it drops below strike

**Profit Profile:**
- Maximum profit = Premium collected
- Breakeven = Strike - Premium
- Theta works FOR you (time decay earns money)

#### 2. Covered Call (CC)

**What It Is:**
- You **own 100 shares** of a stock
- You **sell a call option** against those shares
- You collect **premium upfront**
- You cap your upside at the strike price

**When to Use:**
- You own stock and think it will trade sideways or slightly up
- You want to generate extra income on holdings
- You're willing to sell at the strike price

**Example:**
```
Stock: MSFT trading at $380 (you own 100 shares)
Action: Sell 1 MSFT Nov 15 $390 CALL
Premium: $3.00 ($300)
Days: 21 DTE

Outcomes:
- Stock stays below $390 → Keep shares + $300 premium
- Stock goes above $390 → Sell shares at $390 + keep premium
  Total profit: ($390 - $380) + $3 = $13/share = $1,300
```

**Risk:**
- Opportunity cost: Stock could rally above strike
- Still lose money if stock drops significantly (but premium provides small cushion)

**Profit Profile:**
- Maximum profit = (Strike - Stock Price) + Premium
- Breakeven = Stock Price - Premium
- Theta works FOR you

#### 3. Collar

**What It Is:**
- You **own 100 shares** of a stock
- You **buy a protective put** (downside protection)
- You **sell a covered call** (finance the put)
- Creates a "collar" around your position

**When to Use:**
- You want to protect gains in a stock you own
- Earnings or volatile event approaching
- You want defined risk without paying for insurance

**Example:**
```
Stock: NVDA trading at $500 (you own 100 shares)
Action: 
  - Buy 1 NVDA Nov 15 $480 PUT (costs $5.00)
  - Sell 1 NVDA Nov 15 $520 CALL (collects $5.50)
Net Credit: $0.50 ($50)

Outcomes:
- Stock drops below $480 → Protected! Max loss = $20/share - $0.50 credit = $19.50
- Stock stays $480-$520 → Keep stock + $50 credit
- Stock goes above $520 → Sell at $520, profit = $20 + $0.50 = $20.50
```

**Risk:**
- Upside capped at call strike
- Still responsible for shares if assigned

**Profit Profile:**
- Maximum loss = Stock Price - Put Strike + Net Debit
- Maximum profit = Call Strike - Stock Price + Net Credit
- Theta mostly neutral (short call theta offsets long put theta)

---

### Key Concepts

#### Time Decay (Theta)

**What It Is:**
- Options lose value as expiration approaches
- This loss is called **theta** (measured in $/day)
- When you **sell** options, theta works FOR you

**The Sweet Spot:**
- **21-35 Days to Expiration (DTE)**
- Theta decay accelerates in this window
- Gamma risk still manageable
- Best risk/reward for income strategies

**Why Not Shorter?**
- <10 DTE: Gamma explodes (tiny moves = huge P&L swings)
- Too risky, hard to manage

**Why Not Longer?**
- >45 DTE: Theta too slow (you're "wasting time")
- Capital tied up for low daily returns

#### The Greeks

**Delta (Δ)**
- Rate of change in option price per $1 move in stock
- **Put delta:** -0.30 means option gains $0.30 if stock drops $1
- **Call delta:** +0.40 means option gains $0.40 if stock rises $1
- For income strategies, we target **low delta** (far OTM = safer)

**Gamma (Γ)**
- Rate of change of delta
- High gamma = delta changes rapidly as stock moves
- **Problem for income:** Position risk accelerates near expiration
- We want **low gamma** relative to theta

**Theta (Θ)**
- Daily time decay (usually negative for long options, positive for short)
- **CSP/CC:** Positive theta = you earn money every day
- Measured in dollars per day per contract

**Vega (ν)**
- Sensitivity to implied volatility (IV) changes
- **Short options:** Negative vega (you want IV to drop)
- High IV = collect more premium (but more risk)

#### Theta-to-Gamma Ratio

**Why It Matters:**
- **Theta/Gamma > 3.0:** Ultra-safe but tiny premium (inefficient)
- **Theta/Gamma 0.8-3.0:** Sweet spot (good income, manageable risk)
- **Theta/Gamma < 0.5:** Danger zone (gamma explosion risk)

**Interpretation:**
```
Theta = $5/day, Gamma = 0.03
Ratio = 5 / (100 × 0.03) = 1.67 ✅ Good!

Theta = $2/day, Gamma = 0.08
Ratio = 2 / (100 × 0.08) = 0.25 ❌ Too risky!
```

**Strategy Lab Optimization:**
- Scores positions with 0.8-3.0 ratio highest
- Penalizes extreme ratios (too risky or too conservative)

#### Cushion (Standard Deviations)

**What It Is:**
- Distance from current price to strike, measured in **standard deviations (σ)**
- Uses historical volatility to estimate likely price movement

**Example:**
```
Stock: $100
Strike: $90 (10% OTM)
30-day Historical Volatility: 20%

Expected 1σ move in 30 days = $100 × 0.20 × √(30/365) = $5.73
Cushion = ($100 - $90) / $5.73 = 1.75σ
```

**Interpretation:**
- **<0.5σ:** Very close to ITM, high risk
- **0.75-1.5σ:** Moderate cushion, sweet spot for income
- **>2.0σ:** Very safe, but premium will be small

**Default Settings:**
- Strategy Lab uses **0.75σ minimum** for short-term positions
- Allows higher risk for better yield in 21-35 DTE window

#### Probability of Expiring Worthless (POEW)

**What It Is:**
- Chance the option expires OTM (you keep full premium)
- Calculated using **delta** as probability proxy
- For CSP: POEW = 1 - |put delta|

**Example:**
```
AAPL $170 PUT, delta = -0.25
POEW = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75 = 75% chance of success
```

**Strategy:**
- **60-70% POEW:** Aggressive (higher yield, more risk)
- **70-80% POEW:** Balanced (sweet spot)
- **>80% POEW:** Conservative (safer, lower yield)

**Default:** Strategy Lab uses **60% minimum** for yield focus

## Tab-by-Tab Guide

### Tab 1: Cash-Secured Put (CSP)

**Purpose:** Find the best short put opportunities for income generation.

#### Workflow

1. **Enter Ticker(s)**
   - Single: `AAPL`
   - Multiple: `AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL`
   - Use Pre-Screener results

2. **Adjust Filters** (Sidebar)
   - **Min Days:** 10 (avoid ultra-short)
   - **Max Days:** 45 (avoid long duration)
   - **Min OTM%:** 8% (aggressiveness)
   - **Min ROI% (ann):** 20% (minimum acceptable return)
   - **Min Cushion (σ):** 0.75 (safety buffer)
   - **Min POEW:** 60% (probability of success)
   - **Min Open Interest:** 50 (liquidity)
   - **Max Spread%:** 10% (execution quality)

3. **Review Results**
   - Sorted by **Score** (composite of all factors)
   - Look for 21-35 DTE in green zone
   - Check Theta/Gamma ratio (0.8-3.0 ideal)

4. **Select a Row**
   - Click radio button to select
   - See detailed analysis in other tabs

#### Key Columns

- **Score:** Composite metric (35% ROI, 15% Cushion, 30% Theta/Gamma, 20% Liquidity)
- **OTM%:** How far below current price (higher = safer, lower yield)
- **ROI%_ann:** Annualized return on capital
- **CushionSigma:** Standard deviations of safety margin
- **POEW:** Probability of keeping full premium
- **Theta/Gamma:** Daily income vs. risk ratio
- **Spread%:** Bid-ask spread as % of mid (lower = better liquidity)

#### Best-Practice Fit

Visual indicators show if position meets quality standards:
- ✅ **Green:** Meets criterion
- ❌ **Red:** Fails criterion

**Criteria:**
1. Days in 21-45 range (sweet spot)
2. OTM% ≥ 8% (reasonable distance)
3. Theta/Gamma ≥ 0.8 (efficient income)
4. Cushion ≥ 0.75σ (adequate buffer)
5. POEW ≥ 60% (acceptable probability)
6. ROI ≥ 20% annualized (minimum yield)
7. Spread ≤ 10% (executable)

### Tab 2: Covered Call (CC)

**Purpose:** Generate income on stocks you own or plan to own.

#### Workflow

1. **Enter Ticker**
   - You must own (or plan to own) 100 shares

2. **Adjust Filters**
   - Similar to CSP, but focused on upside cap
   - **Min OTM%:** How much room for appreciation
   - Consider: Are you OK selling at this strike?

3. **Dividend Consideration**
   - Toggle "Include Dividend Yield" if stock pays dividends
   - Adds dividend to total return calculation

4. **Review & Select**
   - Balance premium vs. strike price
   - Don't get greedy—give stock room to breathe

#### Key Differences from CSP

- **Upside Cap:** You sell shares if called away
- **Dividend Risk:** Early assignment if dividend > time value
- **Stock Ownership:** Must own or buy 100 shares first

#### Strategy Tips

- **Neutral to slightly bullish:** Sell ATM or slightly OTM
- **Very bullish:** Sell further OTM (lower premium, more upside)
- **Defensive:** Sell ATM for maximum premium

### Tab 3: Collar

**Purpose:** Protect downside while financing with upside cap.

#### Workflow

1. **Enter Ticker**
   - Must own 100 shares

2. **Set Protection Level**
   - **Put Strike:** How much downside protection? (usually 5-10% below)
   - **Call Strike:** How much upside to give up? (usually 5-10% above)

3. **Analyze Net Cost**
   - **Zero-cost collar:** Put cost = Call premium
   - **Net credit collar:** Call premium > Put cost (preferred)
   - **Net debit collar:** Put cost > Call premium (paying for insurance)

4. **Evaluate Risk/Reward**
   - Max loss defined by put strike
   - Max gain defined by call strike
   - Review whether protection is worth the cap

#### Use Cases

- **Pre-Earnings:** Protect against surprise gap
- **Portfolio Protection:** Hedge during market uncertainty
- **Lock In Gains:** Protect profits on winning positions

### Tab 4: Compare Strategies

**Purpose:** See all three strategies side-by-side for the same ticker.

#### What It Shows

- CSP, CC, and Collar opportunities simultaneously
- Compare risk/reward profiles
- Identify best strategy for current market condition

#### Decision Framework

```
Bullish → CSP (collect premium, willing to own)
Neutral → CC (own stock, milk premium)
Uncertain → Collar (protect + generate income)
```

### Tab 5: Risk (Monte Carlo Simulation)

**Purpose:** Understand probability of loss using simulations.

#### How It Works

1. Simulates **50,000 price paths** using Geometric Brownian Motion
2. Uses implied volatility (or 20% default)
3. Calculates % of paths where you lose money

#### Interpreting Results

- **P(Loss) < 20%:** Conservative position
- **P(Loss) 20-35%:** Moderate risk (acceptable for income)
- **P(Loss) > 40%:** Aggressive, consider reducing size

**Chart:**
- Distribution of simulated outcomes at expiration
- Red line = Strike price (your decision point)

**Important:** This is a **simulation**, not a guarantee. Markets don't follow perfect GBM.

### Tab 6: Playbook (Trade Checklist)

**Purpose:** Pre-trade and post-trade checklists to avoid mistakes.

#### Pre-Trade Checklist

Before entering any trade, verify:

1. ✅ **Position fits account size** (don't over-allocate)
2. ✅ **Earnings date checked** (avoid surprise gaps)
3. ✅ **Greeks reviewed** (theta/gamma ratio acceptable)
4. ✅ **Liquidity confirmed** (tight spread, OI > 50)
5. ✅ **Max loss calculated** (assignment price clear)
6. ✅ **Exit plan defined** (profit target and stop loss)
7. ✅ **Margin/cash verified** (CSP requires full cash, CC requires shares)

#### Post-Trade Checklist

After entering:

1. ✅ **Order filled** (check execution price vs. limit)
2. ✅ **Position logged** (track entry details)
3. ✅ **Alerts set** (technical levels, profit targets)
4. ✅ **Calendar reminder** (check position at 50% profit, 7 DTE)

### Tab 7: Plan & Runbook

**Purpose:** Structured approach to position management.

#### Position Management Rules

**Entry:**
- Only trade 21-45 DTE (sweet spot)
- Max 5% of portfolio per position
- Only tickers with adequate liquidity

**Monitoring:**
- Check daily if <14 DTE
- Check weekly if >14 DTE
- React to earnings announcements immediately

**Exit Scenarios:**

1. **Normal Close (50-75% profit captured)**
   ```
   Entry: Sold for $2.50
   Current: Trading at $0.75
   Profit: ($2.50 - $0.75) / $2.50 = 70% ✅ Close
   ```

2. **Early Assignment (ITM)**
   - CSP: Stock drops below strike → Buy 100 shares
   - CC: Stock rises above strike → Sell 100 shares
   - Accept assignment if within strategy

3. **Roll Forward (extend duration)**
   - Current DTE < 10 and want to continue
   - Buy back current, sell next cycle
   - Must collect net credit

4. **Stop Loss (emergency exit)**
   - Stock moves against you dramatically
   - Premium doubles (100% loss on paper)
   - Consider closing or rolling to reduce loss

#### The 21-Day Rule

**Why 21-35 DTE is optimal:**

| DTE Range | Theta/Day | Gamma Risk | Verdict |
|-----------|-----------|------------|---------|
| 7-10      | High      | Very High  | ❌ Too risky |
| 21-35     | High      | Moderate   | ✅ Sweet spot |
| 45-60     | Moderate  | Low        | ⚠️ Inefficient |
| 60+       | Low       | Very Low   | ❌ Wasting time |

**Strategy:** Enter at 30-45 DTE, close at 50% profit or 14 DTE (whichever comes first).

### Tab 8: Stress Test

**Purpose:** See how position performs under extreme scenarios.

#### Scenarios Tested

1. **+5% Rally:** Stock jumps 5%
2. **-5% Drop:** Stock falls 5%
3. **+10% Rally:** Stock jumps 10%
4. **-10% Drop:** Stock falls 10%
5. **IV +50%:** Implied volatility spikes (fear)
6. **IV -50%:** Implied volatility collapses (calm)

#### Understanding Results

**CSP Example:**
```
Current P&L: +$150
After -10% drop: -$850
Conclusion: Can you handle $850 loss? If not, position too large.
```

**Use This To:**
- Size positions appropriately
- Understand tail risk
- Plan defensive actions

### Tab 9: Overview (Deep Dive)

**Purpose:** Complete analysis of selected position.

#### What It Shows

**Position Details:**
- All contract specifications
- Current Greeks
- Profit/loss scenarios

**Key Metrics:**
- Max profit, max loss, breakeven
- Theta/Gamma ratio
- Time value decay rate

**Profit Capture Targets:**
- **Exit: 50% profit = close when mark ≤ $X**
  - Early exit, high win rate
- **Exit: 75% profit = close when mark ≤ $Y**
  - Balanced, good capital efficiency

**Strategy:**
- Set price alerts at these levels
- Close when hit for consistent wins

**Best-Practice Summary:**
- Visual table showing all quality checks
- Quickly see if position meets standards

**Risk Insights:**
- Probability of loss (Monte Carlo)
- Standard deviation analysis
- Margin/cash requirement

### Tab 10: Roll Analysis

**Purpose:** Decide whether to close or roll expiring positions.

#### When to Use

- Position approaching expiration (< 14 DTE)
- Captured 50%+ profit but want to continue
- Want to extend duration vs. close & redeploy

#### Workflow

1. **Select Current Position**
   - Must have position selected from CSP/CC tab

2. **Set Roll Parameters**
   - **Target Min DTE:** Usually current DTE + 14
   - **Target Max DTE:** Usually current DTE + 30
   - **Same Strike:** Check for lower risk, uncheck for flexibility

3. **Click "Find Roll Candidates"**
   - App scans for next-cycle opportunities
   - Shows extended DTE options

4. **Review Comparison**
   - **Option 1: Close Now**
     - Profit realized immediately
     - Capital freed for redeployment
   - **Option 2: Roll Forward**
     - Additional credit collected
     - Time extension (stay in position)

5. **Decision Framework**

**Roll If:**
- Roll credit > $50 AND
- Extended DTE keeps you in 21-45 sweet spot AND
- Theta/Gamma stays > 0.8

**Close If:**
- Profit captured > 75% OR
- Current DTE < 10 days OR
- Roll credit < $30

**Consider Strike Adjustment:**
- Rolling UP (CSP): Less risk, less premium
- Rolling DOWN (CC): Less risk, less premium
- Rolling same strike: Maintain risk/reward

#### Example

```
Current Position:
AAPL $170 PUT, 7 DTE, Entry $2.50, Current $0.60
Profit Captured: 76%

Roll Option:
AAPL $170 PUT, 28 DTE, Premium $3.20
Roll Credit: $3.20 - $0.60 = $2.60

Decision:
✅ Roll! Collect $260, extend 21 days, stay in sweet spot
```

## Understanding the Metrics

### Score Calculation

**Formula:**
```
Score = 0.35 × ROI_norm 
      + 0.15 × Cushion_norm 
      + 0.30 × ThetaGamma_norm 
      + 0.20 × Liquidity_norm
```

**Components:**

1. **ROI Weight (35%):**
   - Annualized return on capital
   - Normalized to 0-1 scale

2. **Cushion Weight (15%):**
   - Standard deviations of safety
   - Reduced weight for short-term focus

3. **Theta/Gamma Weight (30%):**
   - Income efficiency vs. risk
   - **Highest weight** for 10-45 DTE strategy

4. **Liquidity Weight (20%):**
   - Based on spread % and open interest
   - Critical for entries and exits

**Why These Weights?**

- **Short-term focus:** Theta/Gamma is king (30%)
- **Income goal:** ROI still primary (35%)
- **Risk management:** Cushion prevents disasters (15%)
- **Execution quality:** Liquidity enables the strategy (20%)

### Quality Thresholds

**Default Minimums (Optimized for 10-45 DTE):**

| Metric | Minimum | Rationale |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Days | 10 | Avoid gamma risk |
| Max Days | 45 | Stay in theta sweet spot |
| OTM% | 8% | Reasonable distance |
| ROI% (ann) | 20% | Worth the capital |
| Cushion (σ) | 0.75 | Adequate buffer |
| POEW | 60% | Acceptable probability |
| Theta/Gamma | 0.8 | Efficient income |
| Open Interest | 50 | Minimum liquidity |
| Spread% | 10% | Executable price |

**Adjust Based On:**
- Risk tolerance (higher cushion = safer)
- Yield needs (lower OTM% = more premium)
- Market conditions (increase POEW in volatile markets)

---

## Best Practices

### Position Sizing

**The 5% Rule:**
- Never allocate more than 5% of portfolio to one position
- CSP: Capital at risk = Strike × 100
- CC: Capital at risk = Stock value (100 shares)

**Example:**
```
Portfolio: $100,000
Max per position: $5,000
CSP Strike: $50
Max positions: 1 contract ($5,000 capital)
```

**Diversification:**
- Max 3-5 positions simultaneously
- Different sectors
- Different strategies (CSP + CC + Collar)

### Entry Timing

**Best Times:**
- **Monday/Tuesday:** Full week for theta decay
- **After IV spike:** Sell when premium inflated
- **Post-earnings:** After uncertainty resolved

**Avoid:**
- **Day before earnings:** Massive IV crush risk
- **Friday:** Wastes weekend theta
- **During news events:** Unpredictable gaps

### Exit Discipline

**The 50-75 Rule:**

1. **50% Profit Target:**
   - Close when captured half of max profit
   - High win rate
   - Frees capital quickly

2. **75% Profit Target:**
   - Close when captured 3/4 of max profit
   - Balanced approach
   - Slightly longer hold time

3. **Never Hold to Expiration:**
   - Assignment risk increases
   - Gamma explodes
   - Close or roll at 7 DTE

**Example:**
```
Entry: Sold PUT for $2.00
50% Target: Buy back at $1.00 or less
75% Target: Buy back at $0.50 or less
Max Hold: 7 DTE regardless of P&L
```

### Rolling Strategy

**When to Roll:**
- Profitable position you want to extend
- Losing position that needs time to recover
- 7-14 DTE on current contract

**How to Roll:**
1. Buy back current contract
2. Sell next-cycle contract (21-35 DTE out)
3. Must collect net credit
4. Can adjust strike if needed

**Roll for Credit, Not Hope:**
```
❌ Bad Roll: Pay $1.00 to extend losing position
✅ Good Roll: Collect $0.50 to extend profitable position
```

### Risk Management

**Stop Loss Rules:**

1. **Premium Doubles:** Close if option value 2× entry
   ```
   Entry: Sold for $2.00
   Current: $4.00
   Action: Close (-$200 loss)
   ```

2. **Delta > 0.70:** Position deep ITM, assignment likely
   ```
   CSP Delta: -0.75 (stock well below strike)
   Action: Close or roll down
   ```

3. **Major News:** Earnings miss, regulatory action, etc.
   ```
   News: FDA rejects drug approval
   Action: Close all positions immediately
   ```

**Never Average Down:**
- Don't sell more puts on a falling stock
- Don't add to losing positions
- Accept the loss and move on

### Capital Efficiency

**The Pyramid:**

```
Tier 1 (40% of capital): Ultra-safe CSPs
  - OTM% > 15%
  - POEW > 75%
  - Blue chips only

Tier 2 (40% of capital): Moderate CSPs/CCs
  - OTM% 8-15%
  - POEW 60-75%
  - Quality stocks

Tier 3 (20% of capital): Aggressive plays
  - OTM% 5-8%
  - POEW 55-65%
  - Higher beta stocks
```

**Rebalance Weekly:**
- Move profits from Tier 3 to Tier 1
- Maintain pyramid structure
- Never invert (don't be top-heavy in risk)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "No results found"

**Causes:**
1. Filters too restrictive
2. Ticker has no options
3. API connection issue

**Solutions:**
- Lower Min ROI%, Min POEW thresholds
- Check if ticker is optionable
- Verify Polygon API key

#### "Spread% very high"

**Meaning:**
- Bid-ask spread > 10% of mid price
- Poor liquidity

**Action:**
- Avoid the position
- Slippage will eat your profits
- Find more liquid ticker

#### "Days < 21, risky"

**Meaning:**
- Approaching gamma explosion zone
- Time decay accelerates but risk spikes

**Action:**
- Only trade if very experienced
- Consider closing at 50% profit
- Or roll to next cycle

#### "Theta/Gamma < 0.8"

**Meaning:**
- Premium too low for the gamma risk
- Inefficient position

**Action:**
- Move strike closer to money
- Find different ticker
- Wait for IV to increase

### Data Issues

#### Stale Prices

**Symptom:** Prices not updating

**Fix:**
```bash
# Clear cache
rm -rf ~/.yfinance
# Restart app
```

#### Missing Greeks

**Symptom:** Theta/Gamma show as 0.0

**Cause:** Insufficient data for Black-Scholes

**Fix:**
- Check if IV available
- Ensure DTE > 0
- Verify risk-free rate set

#### Wrong Expiration Dates

**Symptom:** Only weeklies or monthlies showing

**Cause:** yfinance limitations

**Workaround:**

## Advanced Topics

### Implied Volatility (IV) Strategies

**IV Rank:**
- Where current IV stands vs. 52-week range
- High IV Rank (>50): Good time to SELL options
- Low IV Rank (<25): Poor time to sell (wait)

**IV Crush:**
- Post-earnings IV collapse
- Sell BEFORE earnings for high premium
- Exit AFTER earnings before crush

**Example:**
```
Before Earnings: IV = 60%, PUT premium = $3.50
After Earnings: IV = 30%, PUT premium = $1.50
Strategy: Sell 1-2 weeks before, close day after
```

### Delta-Neutral Strategies

**Advanced Collar:**
- Adjust strikes to target zero delta
- Stock gains = Call loss, Stock loss = Put gain
- Pure theta harvesting with hedged directional risk

**Iron Condor (Not in App):**
- Sell OTM put + OTM call
- Buy further OTM put + call for protection
- Collect premium from both sides

### Portfolio Margin

**Standard Margin:**
- CSP requires 100% cash
- CC requires 100 shares owned

**Portfolio Margin:**
- Reduced requirements for offsetting positions
- Collar uses less margin (protected downside)
- Check with broker for eligibility

### Tax Considerations

**Short-Term vs. Long-Term:**
- Options income = short-term capital gains
- Taxed at ordinary income rate
- No special treatment

**Wash Sale Rule:**
- Selling stock at loss + selling puts = potential wash sale
- 30-day window before/after
- Consult tax professional

**Assignment Impact:**
- CSP assignment: Establishes stock cost basis
- CC assignment: Closes stock position
- Track all transactions for tax reporting

### Mechanical/Systematic Approach

**Weekly Routine:**

**Monday AM:**
1. Run Pre-Screener
2. Identify 10-15 candidates
3. Filter for earnings safety

**Monday PM:**
4. Analyze top 5 in depth
5. Enter 2-3 positions (best scores)

**Wednesday:**
6. Check open positions
7. Adjust if needed (roll, close)

**Friday:**
8. Take 50%+ profits
9. Review week's performance
10. Plan next week

**Monthly:**
- Review strategy performance
- Adjust filters if needed
- Rebalance portfolio tiers

### Formula Reference

**Call Delta:**
```
Δ_call = e^(-q×T) × N(d₁)
```

**Put Delta:**
```
Δ_put = -e^(-q×T) × N(-d₁)
```

**Gamma:**
```
Γ = [e^(-q×T) × φ(d₁)] / (S × σ × √T)
```

**Call Theta (per day):**
```
Θ_call = [-S×φ(d₁)×σ×e^(-q×T) / (2×√T) - r×K×e^(-r×T)×N(d₂) + q×S×e^(-q×T)×N(d₁)] / 365
```

**Put Theta (per day):**
```
Θ_put = [-S×φ(d₁)×σ×e^(-q×T) / (2×√T) + r×K×e^(-r×T)×N(-d₂) - q×S×e^(-q×T)×N(-d₁)] / 365
```

**Where:**
- S = Stock price
- K = Strike price
- r = Risk-free rate
- q = Dividend yield
- σ = Volatility
- T = Time to expiration (years)
- N(x) = Cumulative normal distribution
- φ(x) = Standard normal density

**Expected Move (68% CI):**
```
Expected Move = Stock Price × IV × √(DTE / 365)
```
