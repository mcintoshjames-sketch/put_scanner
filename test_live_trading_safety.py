    print("""
The safety mechanism works as follows:

1. **Preview Required**: All live orders must be previewed first
   - preview_order() registers the order hash with timestamp
   - Hash is based on order type, legs, prices, quantities
   
2. **30-Minute Window**: Preview is valid for 30 minutes
   - Prevents stale previews from being executed
   - Forces user to re-review if too much time passes
   
3. **Automatic Cleanup**: After execution, preview is cleared
   - Prevents same order from being executed twice
   - Forces fresh preview for each execution
   
4. **Dry Run Bypass**: Safety mechanism only applies to live trades
   - dry_run=True bypasses all checks
   - Always safe for testing and development

5. **Multiple Safety Layers**:
   ✓ Preview check (order must be previewed first)
   ✓ Client check (API client must be configured)
   ✓ Account check (account ID must be provided)
   ✓ Validation check (order structure must be valid)

This ensures you can NEVER accidentally execute a live trade without:
- Explicitly setting dry_run=False
- Previewing the exact order first
- Having valid API credentials
- All within a 30-minute window
